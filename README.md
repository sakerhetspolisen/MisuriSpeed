# Misuri - Can your smartphone and its sensors estimate your height?
A degree project made by students from Procivitas Helsingborg.

## What is Misuri?
Misuri is an empirical study that aims to evaluate how sensor data from smartphones can be used to estimate or calculate sensitive data about the user. To gain an understanding of this, the study examines the possibility of calculating the user's length with data collected when the user walks. All calculations are done with an Android app called Misuri.

## Who has developed Misuri?
We are three students (Karl, Valentin and Linus) at Procivitas gymnasium in Helsingborg.

## We need you to test our model! ‚ú®
We need to compile a study of how our calculations differ across a large number of users. The more users, the more different user agents and lengths of the user.

### Requirements
- You need a smartphone running Android 10 or later, you can check your Android version using [this](https://whatismyandroidversion.com/) tool
- You need to be between 14 and 25 years old
- You need to be able to walk straight for approx. 50 meters

### Instructions to take part of our application:

1. Allow APK download on your Android phone üì±
2. Download the pre-release version of our Android-app via [this](https://github.com/sakerhetspolisen/MisuriSpeed/releases/tag/1.0) link or in the "Release" part of this repo. üìÇ
3. Go to a place where you can walk around 50 meters in a straight line üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4. Lock the screen rotation on your mobile and set up the sound so you can hear notifications üîî
5. Open the app and approve movement permissions ‚úî
6. Click on "Start measuring your height" and accept location permissions ‚úî
7. Put your mobile phone either in your pocket or in your hand and start walking straight. NOTE: Do not turn off the screen while walking
8. When the phone makes a ringing sound, stop walking
9. Take a screenshot of the screen and send it along with your actual height to [karl@seller.green](mailto:karl@seller.green)
10. Delete the app on your phone
11. If possible, repeat steps 2-9 four more times. The more measurement values we get, the better our theory is supported!
